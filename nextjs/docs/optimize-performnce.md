They‚Äôre a **good start**, Akhilesh ‚Äî but they only cover one slice of the performance pie:

* **`dynamicComponent`** ‚Üí for code-splitting and lazy loading UI chunks.
* **`dynamicFunction`** ‚Üí for code-splitting heavy logic/utilities.

These will help reduce **initial bundle size** and speed up **first load**, especially if you pull out rarely-used components/functions.

But for *full* performance optimization in a Next.js app, you should also think about:

---

### 1. **Static asset optimization**

* Use `next/image` for images (lazy loads + responsive sizes).
* Preload only critical fonts & CSS, defer everything else.

### 2. **Data fetching strategy**

* Prefer `getServerSideProps` / `server actions` for SSR-heavy pages.
* Cache data (React Query, SWR, or Next.js caching headers) to avoid repeated fetches.

### 3. **Tree shaking & module imports**

* Avoid barrel exports for components/utilities that cause huge imports.
* Import only what you need from libraries:

  ```ts
  import debounce from "lodash/debounce"; // ‚úÖ
  import { debounce } from "lodash"; // ‚ùå brings whole lodash
  ```

### 4. **Memoization & renders**

* Use `React.memo` for pure components.
* Use `useMemo` / `useCallback` for expensive recalculations.

### 5. **Bundle analyzer checks**

* Regularly run `ANALYZE=true next build` to catch large dependencies creeping in.
* Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives where possible.

üí° **Bottom line:**
Yes ‚Äî `dynamicComponent` and `dynamicFunction` will take care of *code splitting*, but for real-world apps, you‚Äôll still need **asset optimization, tree shaking discipline, and caching** to fully optimize performance.

If you want, I can make you a **full performance checklist** tailored for your app so you know exactly where to apply each optimization.
