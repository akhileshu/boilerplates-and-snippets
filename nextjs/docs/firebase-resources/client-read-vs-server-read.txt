addPresenceToUsers 
vs 
useUserPresence

✅ Prefer useUserPresence in client components — here's why:
1. It uses hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
Hooks can only run in client components.

Server components don’t support React hooks or browser APIs (like onValue, document, etc.).

2. It's realtime
The hook listens for live updates from Firebase.

Server components are static unless re-rendered; they can't handle realtime data.
