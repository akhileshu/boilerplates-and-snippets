| Spec | Your i3-1215U | Ryzen 5 5600X |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cores / Threads | 6c / 8t | 6c / 12t |
| Sustained power | ~15–28W | ~65W |
| Cache | small | **32MB L3** 🔥 |
| AVX2 throughput | low | **much higher** |
| Thermal throttling | yes | no |

👉 **LLMs LOVE cache + sustained power**.

## ⚡ Real performance difference (what you’d feel)

For **Mistral-7B Q4 (CPU)**:

| Metric | Laptop | 5600X |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First token | 15–30s | **4–7s** |
| Tokens/sec | 2–4 | **8–12** |
| Usability | ❌ painful | ✅ usable |
| Editing files | ❌ no | ✅ yes |
| Streaming | ❌ flaky | ✅ smooth |

That’s **3–4× faster**, _consistently_.

## 🧠 Why desktop feels “usable” and laptop doesn’t

Local LLM UX depends on **time-to-first-token**.

Human tolerance:

* <3s → feels instant
    
* 3–8s → acceptable
    
* 10–30s → feels broken
    
* > 30s → abandon
    

Your laptop sits in the **abandon zone**.  
A 5600X lives in the **acceptable zone**.

## 💰 What ₹50k realistically buys (India)

Typical build:

* Ryzen 5 5600 / 5600X
    
* 32 GB RAM
    
* NVMe SSD
    
* no GPU
    

This is **perfect for CPU LLMs**.
