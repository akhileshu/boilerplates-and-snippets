Title:
Authentication Logic Issue Due to Password Length Mismatch

Affected Organization:
Indian Bank

Application:
Indian Bank NetBanking

Description:
The netbanking system was observed to allow creation of a 17-character  
password on at least one occasion. Subsequently, password creation  
appears to enforce a 16-character limit.

However, during login, the password input field restricts input to  
16 characters, while the backend authentication system continues to  
accept existing passwords longer than 16 characters.

This results in inconsistent password length enforcement between  
password creation, login UI, and backend authentication logic.

Additional Observation:
At the time of testing (19 December 2025, approximately 12:00 PM IST),  
creation of a 17-character password was observed successfully.  
Subsequent attempts to create a password appear to restrict input  
to 16 characters.

Existing accounts with previously created 17-character passwords  
continue to be authenticated successfully by the backend, while  
the login UI restricts password input to 16 characters.


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use an account with an existing 17-character password.
2. Navigate to the login page.
3. Observe that the password field accepts only 16 characters.
4. Using browser developer tools, set the password input value to the original
   17-character password.
5. Submit the login form.
6. Login proceeds as expected.

Expected Result:
Password length rules should be consistent and enforced uniformly  
across password creation, login UI, and backend authentication.

Actual Result:
The login UI restricts password input to 16 characters, while the  
backend authentication system accepts passwords longer than 16  
characters.

Impact:
Users with existing passwords longer than the current login UI limit  
may be unable to log in through normal means, resulting in account  
access issues. This reflects inconsistent enforcement of  
authentication rules.

Severity:
Medium

Testing Scope:
Tested only on my own account with a single proof-of-concept.
No credentials, data access, or exploitation were performed.

Note:
No credentials or login recordings are shared for security reasons.
Attached screenshots (if any) do not contain valid credentials
or sensitive account information.
The issue can be reproduced internally using a test account.
